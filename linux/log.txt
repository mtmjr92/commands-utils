In Linux, logs are stored in the /var/log directory, and you can view them using various commands and tools. Hereâ€™s how to access and display Linux logs:

Common Log Files

1 System Log: /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages

Contains system-wide logs and informational messages.

2 Authentication Log: /var/log/auth.log

Tracks login attempts, SSH logins, etc.

3 Kernel Log: /var/log/kern.log

Kernel-related logs.

4 Application Logs: Logs specific to applications (e.g., Apache, MySQL).

Apache logs: /var/log/apache2/
MySQL logs: /var/log/mysql/

Commands to View Logs

1 View Log File (Static View):

-cat /var/log/syslog

2 Paginated View:

- less /var/log/syslog

Use Space to scroll, q to quit.

3 Follow Logs in Real-Time:

- tail -f /var/log/syslog

This updates dynamically as new logs are added.

4 Search in Logs:

- grep "keyword" /var/log/syslog

Replace keyword with the string you want to search.

5 Filter Logs with journalctl:

View systemd logs:

- journalctl

Real-time logs:

- journalctl -f

Filter by time:

-journalctl --since "2024-12-01 10:00:00"

6 View Kernel Logs:

- dmesg

Example Use Cases

Check login attempts:

- cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "authentication failure"

Debug network issues:

- cat /var/log/syslog | grep "network"

Check disk issues:

- dmesg | grep "sda"

Tips

Use sudo if the log file is restricted:

- sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log

Rotate logs are often compressed (.gz):

- zcat /var/log/syslog.1.gz

Manage log size with logrotate.
